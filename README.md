##Compiler for tinyc ( A reduced adaption of the C language )
Done as a part of the course work for the Compilers Lab course in 5th sem.
Implemented as a series of 6 assignments. The assignment(specs) will be 
added soon. The revision history is available from some point around the 
4th assignment.

The compiler uses Flex for parsing and Bison for grammar and semantic actions.
Make sure you use the latest version of yacc(bison (GNU Bison) 3.0.2 ) to make
it work - which I had found the hard way.

Check out the Makefile to get a hang of the process.

A more descriptive README will be put up soon when I find the energy.
